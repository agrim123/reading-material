## Columns

* PID
  * Process id
* USER
  * Owner of process
* PRI
  * The processâ€™s priority. The lower the number, the higher the priority.
* NI
  * Nice value of process
  * \[-20, 20\] most to least priority
  * nice value only controls CPU time assigned to process and not utilisation of memory and I/O devices.
* VIRT
  * How much virtual memory the process is using.
* RES
  * How much physical RAM the process is using, measured in kilobytes.
* SHR
  * How much shared memory the process is using.
* S
  * The current status of the process \(zombied, sleeping, running, uninterruptedly sleeping, or traced\).
    * S: for sleeping \(idle\)
    * R: for running
    * D: for disk sleep \(uninterruptible\)
    * Z: for zombie \(waiting for parent to read its exit status\)
    * T: for traced or suspended \(e.g by SIGTSTP\)
    * W: for paging
    * I: Idle
* CPU%
  * The percentage of the processor time used by the process.
* MEM%
  * The percentage of physical RAM used by the process.
* TIME+
  * How much processor time the process has used
