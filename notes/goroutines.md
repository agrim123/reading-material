# goroutines

## Go

* Go is a concurrent open source programming language developed at Google.
* Combines native compilation and static types with a lightweight dynamic feel.
* Features
  * Native code generation \(compiled\)
  * Statically typed
  * Composition via interfaces
  * Memory safe
  * Garbage collected
  * Native concurrency support
  * scalable
* Go is Object Oriented, but not in the usual way.
  * no classes \(methods may be declared on any type\)
  * no subtype inheritance
  * interfaces are satisfied implicitly \(structural typing\)

## Goroutines

* Independently executing function, launched by `go` statement.
* has it's own call stack, which grows or shrinks as reqd.
* Very cheap. \(practically running thousands of goroutines.\) \(or lightweight threads\)
* NOT a thread. \(might be only one thread in a program with thousands of goroutines\)
* goroutines are multiplexed dynamically onto threads as needed to keep all the goroutines running.
* communicate via channels

A **channel** provides a connection between goroutines, allowing them to communicate.

## The Go Approach

> Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating

## Channels

* a typed conduit that may be synchronous \(unbuffered\) or asynchronous \(buffered\)
* serve to synchronize execution of concurrently running functions and to provide a mechanism for their communication by passing a value of a specified type
* first class values, can be used anywhere like other values: as struct elements, function arguments, function returning values and even like a type for another channel
