# Pluggable Authentication Modules

* Programs that grant users access to a system use authentication to verify each other's identity \(that is, to establish that a user is who they say they are\).
* The problem is that every time a new authentication scheme is developed, it requires all necessary programs to be rewritten to support it. PAM provides ay to develop programs that are independent of authentication scheme.

## Configuration Files

* `/etc/pam.d/` contains all PAM configuration files.
* Linux-PAM deals with four separate types of \(management\) task.
  * authentication management
  * account management
  * session management
  * password management.
* The association of the preferred management scheme with the behavior of an application is made with entries in the relevant Linux-PAM configuration file. The management functions are performed by modules specified in the configuration file.

### Syntax

The format of each rule is a space separated collection of tokens, the first three being case-insensitive:

```text
type control module-path module-arguments
```
